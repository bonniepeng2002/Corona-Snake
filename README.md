A recreation of the famous Snake game, made during the quarantine to pass time. Coded in Python, the game takes place in a very pixel-y, colorful arcade machine. 
To experience this setting, please download **main.py** and **arcade.gif**, place them both in the same folder and *do not rename*. Enjoy, and stay safe!

# Snake



A recreation of the famous Snake game, made during the quarantine to pass time. Coded in Python, the game takes place in a very pixel-y, colorful arcade machine. To experience this setting, please download the arcade.gif and place in the same folder as the main.py file, and do not rename. Enjoy, and stay safe!
